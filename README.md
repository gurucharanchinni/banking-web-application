<h1>Banking Web Application</h1>
A simple Java-based banking application built using <b>MVC Architecture</b>, <b>Servlets</b>, <b>JSP</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b>. The application enables users to create and manage their bank accounts securely with features like login authentication, money transfers, transaction history, and session-based access control.

<h1>Features</h1>

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create a bank account by entering their personal details along with a unique MPIN and UPI ID. The MPIN and UPI ID are securely encoded using BCrypt before storing in the database.

- **Login Authentication**: Using Mobile Number and MPIN. Users can log in using their registered mobile number and MPIN. Authentication is handled securely by comparing encoded values stored in the database.

- **Form Validation**: Using Servlet Filters. Filters are used to validate user inputs like mobile number format, UPI ID, amount limits, etc. Invalid data is blocked at the filter level before reaching the business logic.

- **View Account Details**: Once logged in, users can view their basic account details such as name, balance, UPI ID, and account number. This page is only accessible if the session is active.

- **Deposit & Withdraw Money**: Users can deposit or withdraw money securely from their account. Transactions update the real-time balance stored in the database.

- **Money Transfer**: Enables users to transfer money to another account using UPI ID and mobile number. Both sender and receiver balances are updated, and the transfer is logged.

- **Transaction History**: Displays a complete list of the userâ€™s past transactions including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Sorted chronologically and retrieved in real-time from the database.

- **Session Management**:  To restrict page access post-login. Uses HttpSession to ensure that sensitive pages are accessible only when a valid session exists. If the session is inactive, the user is redirected to the login page.

- **Logout with Session Invalidation**: Users can safely log out of their account, which removes their session data. After logout, all secure pages are blocked until the user logs in again.

<h1>MVC Architecture</h1>

The project follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern:

- **Model (DAO Package):**  
  Java classes to interact with the database using JDBC.

- **View (WebApp Package):**  
  JSP and JSTL used for rendering UI and displaying responses.

- **Controller (Servlets Package):**  
  Handles routing, business logic, and interaction between model and view.

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>

- **Java** (Servlets, Filters, JDBC)
- **JSP** (Views)
- **PostgreSQL** (Real-Time Transaction Storage)
- **BCrypt** (Secure encoding of MPIN and UPI PIN)
- **Session Management** (`HttpSession`)
